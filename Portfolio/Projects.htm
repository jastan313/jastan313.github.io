							<h3>TScorify</h3>
							<div class="date">March 2016</div>
							<div class="excerpt"><p>TScorify, a Spark application written in Scala, takes a text file dataset and associates each individual file with its keywords. Keywords are selected based on their TF-IDF score. It is accompanied by the TScorify website to display its resulting data of keyword scores in a graphical context.
							<br><br>
							TScorify was developed by myself as a introductory gateway into Spark technologies. I implemented the algorithms necessary to manipulate Spark RDDs and researched how to design a TD-IDF scorer in order to produce the results desired. The website portion is a
							minimalistic site built from HTML/CSS and vanilla JS for data parsing and HTML code generation.

							<h3>GlassMADA</h3>
							<div class="date">Decemeber 2015</div>
							<div class="excerpt"><p>GlassMADA (Memory Assistive Display for Persons with Alzheimer's) is a Google Glass application that supports the users by retreiving lost personal information. The app functions to bring back independence to its user in a therapeutic manner. The app satisfies its objective by performing person recognition (name, relationship status, and other desired information) through passive QR scanning and by displaying past daily information derived from passive, contextually-aware photo-taking.
							<br><br>
							GlassMADA is comprised of three parts: GlassMADA (Google Glass application), the Flask server, and MADA Timeline (the web application). I was responsible for designing the RESTful API for communication between the three components. In addition, I worked independently on the MADA Timeline (mostly vanilla JS and HTML/CSS), implementing a JSON parser and bit64 decoder for the contextual data requested from the server and developing the Timeline's UI to display this information.

							<h3>Battle Blocks</h3>
							<div class="date">June 2015</div>
							<div class="excerpt"><p>Battle Blocks is a physics-simulated “sandbox”, 4-player MOBA game where players build and personalize combating robots block by block. Players build their robot and fight in a literal sandbox in a King of the Hill style game mode. Players within the Money Zone (the hill) are awarded Lunch Money which can be used to purchase additional blocks to upgrade their robot. Buyable blocks include: melee weapons such as maces, ranged weapons such as cannons, new wheels for increased manuverability, and building blocks which increase robot health and grant additional effects. And of course, in combat, these appended blocks do fall off upon receiving critical damage!
							<br><br>
							Built from scratch, the game consists of about 20,000 lines of C++ code, ranging from Bullet physics engine to openGL, 3D models created in Blender, and soundbytes from SFML. My partner and I worked on the entire server-side (includes server-side network, game logic, and game physics) together. Examples of a few specific features I worked on: developing custom packets to send game data to client for graphics rendering, designing and creating game event APIs to communicate with the client, implementing collision events and constraint system (orientation of blocks and breaking off blocks), and designing and implementing the damage system.
